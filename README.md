# ðŸ©º AI Disease Prediction

An AI-powered web application built with **Flask** and **Machine Learning** to predict possible diseases based on user-reported symptoms.  
This project also provides additional health-related resources such as diet plans, disease information, and treatment recommendations.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Disease Prediction** using trained ML models.
- **Interactive Web Interface** built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Symptom Severity Analysis** from dataset.
- **Diet Recommendations** for predicted diseases.
- **Contact & Blog Pages** for health awareness.
- **Responsive UI** with Bootstrap.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Details
This project uses multiple CSV datasets for prediction and recommendation:
- **Symptom-severity.csv** â†’ Severity score for each symptom.
- **symtoms_df.csv** â†’ List of all symptoms mapped to diseases.
- **description.csv** â†’ Detailed information about diseases.
- **diets.csv** â†’ Recommended diets for different diseases.
- **medications.csv** â†’ Suggested medicines and dosages.
- **precautions_df.csv** â†’ Preventive measures for diseases.
- **workout_df.csv** â†’ Exercises for managing diseases.

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
The system is powered by multiple ML algorithms:
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**

ðŸ“Œ Models are trained on curated symptomâ€“disease datasets and saved as `.pkl` files for fast prediction.
